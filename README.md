# Multiplayer Chess Platform 
A) Developed a Web based application where users can :
Sign up for an account. Initiate a new match or join an ongoing one. Facilitate move-by-move
gameplay during each match. Implement a dynamic rating system that adjusts based onperfor-
mance, similar to traditional chess ratings.
B) Developed the frontend using ReactJS and built the backend using NodeJS and employed
Typescript as the primary programming language.
C) Utilized separate WebSocket servers to manage real-time gameplay, with Redis employed to
store all game moves in a queue for efficient processing.
